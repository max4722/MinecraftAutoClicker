  * Must be done with Minecraft closed
  * To access your .minecraft folder, open explorer and paste this into the address bar: `%appdata%\\.minecraft`

To Use:

Simply do the action you want to repeat once and then bring up the menu. Go into the application and click "Start".

Once you click start, you will have 3 seconds to go into the game and exit the menu. When the countdown hits 0, the program will run and will auto tab you out of the game.

When you want to stop, click "Stop" and it will stop the action.
